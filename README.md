## here i stand today, i may lay on my back tomorrow. with the sand on my feet, quietly watching the sunset, the waves roaring, the wind whistling, it's heaven. they may have defeated me, but they should know that the dead shall rise again and walk these lands. death did i say? there is no death, only a change of worlds.
